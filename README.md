Onyx DataDNA Challenge for June - GitHub Report
Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis and visualization for the Onyx DataDNA Challenge for June. The objective of the challenge was to analyze the provided dataset and derive meaningful insights using Power BI and PowerPoint.

Tools Used
Power BI: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.
PowerPoint: For presenting the findings and insights derived from the data analysis.
Data Description
The dataset provided for the challenge includes various metrics and dimensions relevant to the analysis objectives. The key performance indicators (KPIs) analyzed include Conversion Rate (CR), Engagement Rate (ER), Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS), Cost per Thousand Impressions (CPM), Return on Investment (ROI), Revenue per Click (RPC), and Revenue per Conversion (RP Conv). Traffic metrics include Impressions, Clicks, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Cost per Click (CPC).

Analysis Summary
Using Power BI, we conducted a detailed analysis focusing on the following KPIs:

Performance KPIs:
Conversion Rate (CR): Percentage of users completing a desired action.
Engagement Rate (ER): User interaction with campaign content.
Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS): Revenue generated per advertising dollar spent.
Cost per Thousand Impressions (CPM): Cost to reach a thousand potential customers.
Return on Investment (ROI): Campaign profitability.
Revenue per Click (RPC): Revenue from each click.
Revenue per Conversion (RP Conv): Revenue from each conversion.

Traffic KPIs:
Impressions: Frequency of content display.
Clicks: Number of times users clicked on the content.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): Percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks.
Cost per Click (CPC): Cost of each click on the content.
Key Findings
Cost-to-Profit Ratio: Achieved a positive cost-to-profit ratio of 0.10.
ROI: The campaign demonstrated a strong ROI of 10.41%.

Optimization: Identified areas for improvement in campaign performance across different channels and locations.
